A framework and toolkit for building programming language tools. Basic idea: start with abstract syntax, for both definition and representation. Transform ASTs via reduction. Semantics and concrete syntax both defined by reduction from AST.

Prototype based on meta-programming approach. Can implement real programs on the scale of moderately complex expressions with arbitrary and dynamic syntax extension.

Typographically-rich presentation combining mathematical notation with conventional ideas. Based on concepts from \TeX. \todo{}
