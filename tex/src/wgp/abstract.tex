Researchers and professionals in many fields are increasingly interested in defining new computer languages, but existing tools are not well-suited to this use. When popular general-purpose languages are extended, or when new text-based languages are created, the problem of parsing and the fundamental limits of text severely limit the form languages can take. On the other hand, a number of recent projects take a different approach wherein programs are stored in some sort of opaque tree structure. Instead of defining a parser, the language designer/user defines the abstract syntax
