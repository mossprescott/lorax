\section{Expression Language}
\label{expr}

A new language for displaying programs, mathematical expressions, and simple graphical elements.

Nodes represent visual elements at a fairly abstract level. Source program is reduced to expression language.

From \TeX: algorithms, symbols, inspiration.

Space is part of the language. Parentheses are inserted as needed by a generic transformation (no need for language designer or user to worry about it).
