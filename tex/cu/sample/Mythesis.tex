\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% one page only ??

	Solid fuel rocket engines are one of the most
	reliable and efficient propulsion systems used
	to lift payloads into orbit, in terms of
	$\lambda=(\Box+\Diamond)\psi$.  Used throughout
	the astrodynamics community, the theory of the
	flow within the motor chamber is in fact
	a black art which defies all attempts at
	analysis.
	
	The present work (no exception to
	the statement above) contains a theoretical
	and numerical approach to the flow of the
	gases within the motor chamber.  The shape of
	the chamber and original fuel configuration,
	and the patterns of combustion and
	flow/expulsion of gases, are modelled by a
	system of thirty fourth-degree differential
	equations.
	
	$$
		f_i^{(34)}(x,y,z,t) =
		\sum_{j=0}^{33}
		a_{ij}f_i^{({\rm j})}(x,y,z,t)
	$$
	
	Acceptable numerical solutions
	would require one thousand pentium processors
	working day and night for $10^{11.2}$ years.
